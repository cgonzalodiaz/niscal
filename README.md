# niscal
Near Infrared Spectroscopy Calibrator (NISCAL) calculates the telluric correction function from the observed telluric star spectrum and a list of templates defined by the user. The code finds the best matching template and applies the telluric correction to the science data. Flux calibration is applied based on the magnitude of the telluric star in the 2MASS catalogue.
